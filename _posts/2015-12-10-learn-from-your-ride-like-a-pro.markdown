With the RideData app you can learn from your riding style like pros do! With an IMU on your motorcycle you and the RideData app you can record gravity data from your bike, with that you can learn about HOW your bike moves and identify problems, trends and weaknesses you may never have before. The RideData app records where you are and how your bike is reacting to gravity. Race teams have used similar data for years to learn how to go faster. The same technology is now easier than ever to attach to your bike and record with your phone!
